## About

I used to be a bookkeeper. I learned to code because I enjoyed their work more than my own. The programmers I contracted for were doing challenging and intense work. I wanted to do that too, so I studied web development through the online program, <a href = "https://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>. I love it, and I look forward to learning more about all-things-development. When I'm not cooking up code, I'm cooking something in the kitchen. You can check out my resume <a href = "https://resume.creddle.io/resume/hnkrsnqlmwd" target="_blank">here</a>.
